<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in a small town in Indiana. I was raised in a split household with two working parents. They taugh me to work hard, be kind and honest, and to learn from every situation.</p> 
<br>
<p>I have always had a passion for learning. Growing up I was one of the only kids excited to go to school. When I was 16 I had the opportunity to attend my first class on computer programming. I started learning Python
and realized I had a new passion.</p>
<br> 
<p>I enjoy problem-solving and creating new things. Programming has given me the opportunity to creatively solve problems. Recently I have been expanding my knowledge for software
development. I have started learning to create MODS for some of my favorite video games and attending classes to receive a degree in Software Development. I have improved my skills
with Python and Microsoft services like Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. I have also learned new skills like knowledge of software development methodologies, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
Raptor, and Data Analytics.</p>
